# Yoisho
A Bukkit plugin I made for a personal Minecraft server, named after said server. It adds a warps feature to the game, along with the option to set a coordinate-specific first spawn point for all players to spawn at, since bukkit spawns players in a radius instead of a set location.

Commands are:
 - warp: Warp to a another location  
 - warps: See a list of warps
 - setwarp: Set a new warp
 - delwarp: Delete a warp  
 - setpermwarp: Set avpermanent warp  firstspawnpoint: Set the server's first spawn point 
 - addpermission: Give a player access to private warp 
 - removepermission: Remove a player's access to private warp 
 - viewwhitelist: View what players have access to private warp
